			<div field="text" class="t-text t-text_md  ">How often do you say Fuck you to anyone or rather think it during the day. How many times does the person deserve to be fucked? A lot more than you can say, i guess. <br /><br /><br /> So now you have an opportunity to send as many fucks as you want to anybody, anywhere in the world and let to know the whole universe about this great happening. <br /><br /><br /> How it works: <br /><br /> 1rst - purchase fuckyoutokens from your erc-20 comparable wallet <br /><br /> 2nd - type in your message or upload any picture you want <br /><br /> 3rd - send your message to the person ought to be fucked. The system posts it to the facebook and twitter. Also, your greeting will be сemented at a blockchain and the website. Punish the jerk! Let the whole world know that that person was fucked. Humiliate. Dominate. <br /><br /><br /> Once you compose your message it will be displayed at <a href="http://youfucked.man" style="">www.youfucked.man</a> and delivered straight to the victim. It does not even need to have ether wallet or know about blockchain - the message will spread around the world. Each block sized  of 10x10 pixels powered by token. More tokens you buy - larger picture you get. A half of the funds expends to the promotion and social media management purposes. The fucking machine will take care that as many people as it possible know about what happened. Nobody can escape, no one can hide. It's the destiny to be fucked and ashamed, once you decide. Rule the situation. Rule the reputation. <br /><br /><br /> So, let's enumerate the benefits once again: <br /><br /><br /> 1. You can fuck anyone as many times as you wish <br /><br /> 2. You can do it anonymously, or personally <br /><br /> 3. There is a "board of honor" where the fucked will be pinned <br /><br /> 4. It'll be posted at facebook and twitter, and promoted by the team <br /><br /> 5. Pour buddy doesn't even need to have an etherium wallet or even know about blockchain. The message will get him anyway <br /><br /> 6. You can express your opinion (as many times as you want) and sell the tokens. The dimensions of the website is fixed and amount of tokens is limited . Most likely the price of tokens will boost. Buy it, fuck them, earn money. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
